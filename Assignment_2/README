The given folder contains five files

1. Theoritical part(neural networks)
2. Artificial_neural_networks(Assignment-2).ipynb
3. Output of the dataset in excel file summarizing the results
4. Plots of model accuracy against number of epochs
5. Report

Note: The output of the dataset in tabular format and plots of model history are added in report as well.

1. Theoritical part(neural networks)
   Consists of steps of derviation for gradient descent training rule with single unit neuron and compared the activation functions sigmoid and tanh.

2. Artificial_neural_networks(Assignment-2).ipynb
-----------------------
(i) This is written on google collaboratory. Please download the file and then open google colab and then click on File->Upload Notebook and then upload the file.
The dataset is hosted on public repository and hence not required to download(https://github.com/bmounikareddy98/Machine-learning-assignments/blob/main/Assignment_2/Churn_Modelling.csv)

(ii) On the top right, click on "connect"->"view resources"->Change Runtime Type and select Hardware accelerator as GPU and save.
(ii) Execute the commands written on each line and the corresponding output will be shown below the cell.
(iv)The libraries used are:
    1. numpy 
    2. matplotlib
    3. pandas  
    4. tensorflow
    5. sklearn

3. Output of the dataset in excel file summarizing the results
   This consists of record of our trials showing accuracies and rmse with different combinations of hyperparameters.

4. Plots of model accuracy against number of epochs
   This consists of plots between model accuracy and number of epochs for different activation functions and number of neurons in hidden layers.

5. Report
   The report consists of the log of our trials with different hyperparameters, answers to questions, and plots.
