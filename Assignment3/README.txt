1. Theoretical part: Consisting of steps of derivation for each of the problems given.


2. Part_2(K-means_Clustering.ipynb)

(i) This is written on google collaboratory. Please download the .ipynb file and then open google colab and then click on File->Upload Notebook and then upload the file.
The dataset is hosted on public repository and hence not required to download(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmounikareddy98/Machine-learning-assignments/main/Assignment3/bbchealth.txt)

(ii) On the top right, click on "connect"->"view resources"->Change Runtime Type and select Hardware accelerator as GPU and save.
(ii) Execute the commands written on each line and the corresponding output will be shown below the cell.
(iv)The libraries used are:
    1. random
    2. re
    3. math
    4. string
    5. urllib.request

3. Table of the results for Part_2.
   This consists of SSE and size of each cluster for different values of k.


4. Report
   The report consists of brief explanation of different steps used in the model such as data pre-processing, creation of k-means algorithm using different combinations of k and, log of our results with different k values.
